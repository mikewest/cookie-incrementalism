--- abstract

This document proposes two changes to cookies inspired by the properties of the HTTP State Tokens
mechanism proposed in {{I-D.west-http-state-tokens}}. First, cookies should be treated as
`SameSite=Lax` by default. Second, cookies that explicitly assert `SameSite=None` in order to enable
cross-site delivery should also be marked as `Secure`.

# Introduction

The HTTP State Tokens proposal ({{I-D.west-http-state-tokens}}) aims to replace cookies with
a state management mechanism that has better security and privacy properties. That proposal is
somewhat aspirational: it's going to take a long time to come to agreement on the exact contours
of a cookie replacement, and an even longer time to actually do so.

While we're debating the details of a new state management primitive, it seems quite reasonable to
reevaluate some aspects of the existing primitive: cookies. When we can find consensus on some
aspect of HTTP State Tokens, we can apply those aspirations to cookies, driving incremental
improvements to state management in the status quo.

Based on conversations at {{HTTP-Workshop-2019}} and elsewhere, I'd suggest that we have something
like agreement on at least two principles:

1.  HTTP requests should not carry state along with cross-site requests by default (see Section 8.2
    of {{RFC6265bis}}).

2.  HTTP requests should not carry state over non-secure channels (see Section 8.3 of
    {{RFC6265bis}}, and {{RFC7258}}).

With those principles in mind, this document proposes two changes that seem possible to deploy in
the near-term. User agents should:

1.  Treat the lack of an explicit `SameSite` attribute as `SameSite=Lax`. That is, the `Set-Cookie`
    value `key=value` will produce a cookie equivalent to `key=value; SameSite=Lax`. Cookies that
    require cross-site delivery can explicitly opt-into such behavior by asserting `SameSite=None`
    when creating a cookie.

    This is spelled out in more detail in {{lax-default}}.

2.  Require the `Secure` attribute to be set for any cookie which asserts `SameSite=None` (similar
    conceptually to the behavior for the `__Secure-` prefix). That is, the `Set-Cookie` value
    `key=value; SameSite=None; Secure` will be accepted, while `key=value; SameSite=None` will be
    rejected.

    This is spelled out in more detail in {{require-secure}}.

Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of {{!RFC5234}}.


# Monkey-Patches against RFC6265bis

## "Lax" by Default {#lax-default}

The processing algorithm in Section 5.3.7 of {{RFC6265bis}} treats the absence of a `SameSite`
attribute in a `Set-Cookie` header as equivalent to the presence of `SameSite=None`. Cookies are
therefore available for cross-site delivery by default, and developers may opt-into more security by
setting some other value explicitly. Ideally, we'd invert that such that developers who accepted the
risks of cross-site delivery (see Section 8.2 of {{RFC6265bis}}) could opt into them, while
developers who didn't make any explicit choice would be protected by default.

We could accomplish this goal by first altering the processing algorithm, replacing the current step
1:

~~~
1.  Let "enforcement" be "None".
~~~

with the following two steps:

~~~
1.  Let "enforcement" be "Default".

2.  If cookie-av's attribute-value is a case-insensitive
    match for "None", set "enforcement" to "None".
~~~

And then by, altering step 13 of the cookie storage model (Section 5.4 of {{RFC6265bis}}) from:

~~~
13. If the cookie-attribute-list contains an attribute
    with an attribute-name of "SameSite", set the cookie's
    same-site-flag to attribute-value (i.e. either "Strict",
    "Lax", or "None"). Otherwise, set the cookie's
    same-site-flag to "None".
~~~

to:

~~~
13. If the cookie-attribute-list contains an attribute
    with an attribute-name of "SameSite" and an
    attribute-value of "Strict", "Lax", or "None", set the
    cookie's same-site-flag to attribute-value. Otherwise,
    set the cookie's same-site-flag to "Default".
~~~

And finally by altering the fifth bullet point of step 1 of the cookie-string construction algorithm
in Section 5.5 of {{RFC6265bis}} from:

~~~
 *  If the cookie's same-site-flag is not "None", and the HTTP
    request is cross-site (as defined in Section 5.2) then exclude
    the cookie unless all of the following statements hold:

    1.  The same-site-flag is "Lax"

    2.  The HTTP request's method is "safe".

    3.  The HTTP request's target browsing context is a top-level
        browsing context.
~~~

to:

~~~
 *  If the cookie's same-site-flag is not "None", and the HTTP
    request is cross-site (as defined in Section 5.2) then exclude
    the cookie unless all of the following statements hold:

    1.  The same-site-flag is "Lax" or "Default".

    2.  The HTTP request's method is "safe".

    3.  The HTTP request's target browsing context is a top-level
        browsing context.
~~~

This would have the effect of mapping the default behavior in the absence of an explicit `SameSite`
attribute, as well as the presence of any unknown `SameSite` value, to the "Lax" behavior,
protecting developers by making cross-site delivery an explicit choice, as opposed to an implicit
default.


### "Lax-Allowing-Unsafe" Enforcement {#lax-allowing-unsafe}

The "Lax" enforcement mode described in Section 5.3.7.1 of {{RFC6265bis}} allows a cookie to be sent
along with cross-site requests if and only if they are top-level navigations with a "safe" HTTP
method. Implementation experience shows that this is difficult to apply across the board, and it may
be reasonable to temporarily carve out cases in which some cookies that rely on today's default
behavior can continue to be delivered as the default is shifted to "Lax" enforcement.

One such carveout, described in this section, accommodates certain cases in which it may be
desirable for a cookie to be excluded from non-top-level cross-site requests, but to be sent with
all top-level navigations regardless of HTTP request method.

For example, a login flow may involve a cross-site top-level POST request to an endpoint which
expects a cookie with login information. For such a cookie, "Lax" enforcement is not appropriate, as
it would cause the cookie to be excluded due to the unsafe HTTP request method. On the other hand,
"None" enforcement would allow the cookie to be sent with all cross-site requests. For a cookie
containing potentially sensitive login information, this may not be desirable.

In order to retain some of the protections of "Lax" enforcement (as compared to "None") while still
allowing cookies to be sent cross-site with unsafe top-level requests, user agents may choose to
provide an intermediate "Lax-allowing-unsafe" enforcement mode. A cookie whose enforcement mode is
"Lax-allowing-unsafe" will be sent along with a cross-site request if and only if it is a top-level
request, regardless of request method.

User agents may choose to apply this enforcement mode instead of "Lax" enforcement, but only in a
limited or restricted fashion. Such restrictions may include applying "Lax-allowing-unsafe" only to
cookies that did not explicitly specify `SameSite=Lax` (i.e., those whose same-site-flag was set to
"Default" by default) with creation-time more recent than a duration of the user agent's choosing (2
minutes seems reasonable).

This is done by further modifying the previously mentioned fifth bullet point of step 1 of the
cookie-string construction algorithm in Section 5.5 of {{RFC6265bis}} from:

~~~
 *  If the cookie's same-site-flag is not "None", and the HTTP
    request is cross-site (as defined in Section 5.2) then exclude
    the cookie unless all of the following statements hold:

    1.  The same-site-flag is "Lax" or "Default".

    2.  The HTTP request's method is "safe".

    3.  The HTTP request's target browsing context is a top-level
        browsing context.
~~~

to:

~~~
 *  If the cookie's same-site-flag is not "None", and the HTTP
    request is cross-site (as defined in Section 5.2) then exclude
    the cookie unless all of the following statements hold:

    1.  The same-site-flag is "Lax" or "Default".

    2.  The HTTP request's method is "safe", or the cookie meets
        the user agent's requirements for being granted
        "Lax-allowing-unsafe" enforcement.

    3.  The HTTP request's target browsing context is a top-level
        browsing context.
~~~

As a more permissive variant of "Lax" mode, "Lax-allowing-unsafe" mode necessarily provides fewer
protections against CSRF.  Ultimately, the provision of such an enforcement mode should be seen as a
temporary measure to ease adoption of "Lax" enforcement by default.


## Requiring "Secure" for "SameSite=None" {#require-secure}

Cookies sent over plaintext HTTP are visible to anyone on the network. As section 8.3 of
{{RFC6265bis}} points out, this visibility exposes substantial amounts of data to network attackers.
We know, for example, that long-lived and stable cookies have enabled pervasive monitoring
{{RFC7258}} in the past (see Google's PREF cookie {{pref-cookie}}), and we know that a secure
transport layer provides significant confidentiality protections against this kind of attack.

We can, to a reasonable extent, mitigate this threat by ensuring that cookies intended for
cross-site delivery (and therefore likely to be more prevalent on the wire than cookies scoped down
to same-site requests) require secure transport.

That is, we can require that any cookie which asserts `SameSite=None` must also assert the `Secure`
attribute (Section 4.1.2.5 of {{RFC6265bis}}) by altering the storage model defined in Section 5.4 of
{{RFC6265bis}}, inserting the following step after the existing step 14:

~~~
15. If the cookie's "same-site-flag" is "None", abort
    these steps and ignore the cookie entirely unless
    the cookie's secure-only-flag is true.
~~~

This is conceptually similar to the requirements put into place for the `__Secure-` prefix (Section
4.1.3.1 of {{RFC6265bis}}).


# Security and Privacy Considerations

## CSRF

`SameSite` is a reasonably robust defense against some classes of cross-site request forgery
attacks, as described in Section 8.8.1 of {{RFC6265bis}}, but developers need to opt-into its
protections in order for them to have any effect. That is, developers are vulnerable to CSRF
attacks by default, and must do some work to shift themselves into a more defensible position.

The change proposed in {{lax-default}} would invert that requirement, placing the burden on the
small number of developers who are building services that require state in cross-site requests.
Those developers would be empowered to opt-into the status quo's less-secure model, while developers
who don't intend for their projects to be embedded in cross-site contexts are protected by default.


## Secure Transport

As discussed in Section 8.3 of {{RFC6265bis}}, cookies delivered over plaintext channels are
exposed to intermediaries, and thereby enable pervasive monitoring {{RFC7258}}. The change proposed
in {{require-secure}} above would set secure transport as a baseline requirement for all stateful
cross-site requests, thereby reducing the risk that these cookies can be cataloged or modified by
network attackers.

Requiring secure transport for cookies intended for cross-site usage has the exciting secondary
effect of increasing pressure on entities that produce embeddable content to migrate their
products to HTTPS. That has security benefits for those third-party products themselves, but also
has the effect of removing the potential of mixed content ({{mixed-content}}) as a blocker to
first-party migration to HTTPS.

Note that in the long term, it seems quite reasonable to take the additional step of requiring the
`Secure` attribute for all cookies, regardless of their `SameSite` value. That would have more
substantial impact on pervasive monitoring and network attackers generally. This document's proposal
limits itself to `SameSite=None` because that seems like a low-hanging, high-value change that's
deployable in the near term. User agents are encouraged to find additional subsets for which
`Secure` can be required.


## Tracking

The proposals in this document do not in themselves mitigate the privacy risks described in Section
7.1 of {{RFC6265bis}}. Entities who wish to use cookies to track user activity from cross-site
contexts can continue to do so by setting cookies that declare themselves as `SameSite=None`.

Requiring that explicit declaration, however, gives user agents the ability to easily distinguish
cookies used for stateful cross-site requests from those with narrower scope. After the change
proposed in {{lax-default}}, only those cookies that make an explicit `SameSite=None` declaration
can be directly used for cross-site tracking. It may make sense for user agents to use that
information to give users different controls for these cookies, or to apply different policies for
expiration and delivery.


# Implementation Considerations

## Sequencing

The steps described in this document don't need to be taken at the same time. It's quite possible
that it will be less disruptive to deploy `SameSite=Lax` as a default first, and then to require the
`Secure` attribute for any explicitly `SameSite=None` cookie as a subsequent step.

User agents are encouraged to adopt these recommendations in whatever order they believe will lead
to the widest, most expedient deployment.


## Deployment

It's possible that a middle-ground between `SameSite=Lax` and `SameSite=None` could be a better
balance between doing what developers want by default, and mitigating CSRF by default.
{{I-D.west-cookie-samesite-firstparty}} explores the possibility of integrating First-Party Sets
{{first-party-set}} with the `SameSite` attribute in order to allow entities that shard themselves
across multiple registrable domains to maintain stateful communication between them (to support
single-sign on, for example).

It's possible that user agents who support First-Party Sets could reduce the deployment overhead
for developers, and increase the robustness of a site's CSRF defense for
cross-site-but-not-cross-party cookies by defaulting to something like that document's
`FirstPartyLax` instead of `Lax`.
